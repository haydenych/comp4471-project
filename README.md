# COMP4471 Project - Synthetic Data Generation

Synthetic data has become more and more important as
deep learning advances. This work attempts to investigate
the importance and limitations of synthetic data in image
classification using different Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) models. We start by evaluating the GANs using
Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and then train a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) with a combination of the
data sets and observe the accuracies. Results from the experiments
show that GANs might fool the CNN into learning
the generated distribution instead, if improperly monitored.
